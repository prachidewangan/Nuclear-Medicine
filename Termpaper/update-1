\maketitle

\section*{Aim}
To study about the potential of several nuclear medicine techniques in the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumours and stresses the renewed role of nuclear medicine in the management of this disease. 
\section*{Keywords}
     
\section*{ Term paper highlights}

\begin{itemize}
    \item About neuroendocrine tumors 
    \item Radiopharmaceuticals for neuroendocrine tumours imaging. 
    \item Clinical applications of nuclear medicine imaging. 
\end{itemize} 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{scintigraphy:}  a technique in which a scintillation counter or similar detector is used with a radioactive tracer to obtain an image of a bodily organ or a record of its functioning.  
    \item \textbf{neuroendocrine tumours:}  A tumor that forms from cells that release hormones into the blood in response to a signal from the nervous system.
     \item \textbf{Radiopharmaceuticals:}  agents used to diagnose certain medical problems or treat certain diseases
     \item \textbf{Dosimeters:}  It is a device that measures dose uptake of external ionizing radiation.
     \item \textbf{angiography:}  is a type of X-ray used to check blood vessels.
     \item \textbf{Radiation:}  the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles, especially high-energy particles which cause ionization.
