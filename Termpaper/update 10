\section{Introduction}

Low incidence, low proliferation rate, and sometimes hypersecretion of biologically active chemicals are all characteristics that separate neuroendocrine tumours from other cancers. Because of the presence of unique secretory products and cytoplasmic proteins, they have a distinct histological pattern. These tumours have been the subject of research for the past 20 years, with the goal of better biological classification and the development of new management techniques. As a result, tremendous progress has been made in both diagnosis and therapy\cite{rindi2000introduction}.\\ \\
In terms of imaging procedures, advances in computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), ultrasonography (US), intraoperative ultrasonography, angiography, and nuclear medicine have substantially aided tumour evaluation and, in general, led to the earlier detection of tiny tumour masses. Because many techniques have been developed in recent years, based on several different radiopharmaceuticals, and these new techniques have successfully been used to visualise neuroendocrine tumours, nuclear medicine has become increasingly involved in this topic. This is due to the different metabolic pathways and features of neuroendocrine tissue. Despite the fact that neuroendocrine tumours are rather uncommon, nuclear medicine professionals are frequently faced with the diagnosis of neuroendocrine lesions in their daily practise. Only the most relevant approaches in present clinical practise will be discussed in this review, as well as future views arising from ongoing experimental data\cite{capella1995revised}.

\section{Radiopharmaceuticals for neuroendocrine tumours imaging }
The radiopharmaceuticals used to visualise neuroendocrine tumours are chosen based on different metabolic pathways. In nuclear medicine, various tracers have been proposed; some are based on specific absorption mechanisms, while others are non-specific probes. It is important to note that, even if a specific absorption mechanism exists, it is not unique to a certain tumour type, as neuroendocrine cells are found throughout the body. Neuroendocrine cells, in reality, form small organs, separate cell clusters inside other tissues, or a network of cells scattered across the lungs, stomach, thymus, and thyroid\cite{estrozi2011neuroendocrine}. This is why each tracer can be utilised for a variety of clinical indications. Only the most important tracers will be considered in this review: some are currently in clinical use, such as metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) and pentetreotide; others are of potential interest, such as positron emitters radiopharmaceuticals, VIP, and several new somatostatin analogues; others have historical value, such as radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies; and others will be phased out, such as 99mTc (V)\cite{ahmed2020gastrointestinal}. 


\subsection{Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)}
MIBG is made up of a benzyl group from bretylium and a guanidine group from guanithidine. In the early 1980s, radiolabelled MIBG was created to visualise disorders of the adrenal medulla. It is structurally similar to norepinephrine. It is taken up in the cell membrane of sympathomedullary tissues via an active, sodium- and energy-dependent (Type 1) amine absorption mechanism. It is carried into the intracellular catecholamine storage vesicles once it reaches the cytoplasm. MIBG is able to reach neuroendocrine circuits as a result of this absorption mechanism. The average component that allows for high selective uptake and imaging is the prolonged storage within the vesicles. Both 131I and I23I can be used to label MIBG. Injectable activity in adults ranges from 18.5 to 37 MBq for 13II-MIBG and 185 to 370 MBq for 123I-MIBG\cite{carvao2021neuroendocrine}. The 123I-labeled agent is the radiopharmaceutical of choice, according to theoretical considerations and clinical experience. It produces higher-quality images, has greater photon detection, and is more sensitive. To do single photon emission thomography, these properties are required (SPECT). Nonetheless, owing of its lower costs, availability, extended half-life, and ability to acquire delayed scans, I31I-MIBG is still frequently used for most regular applications. \\ \\
Even though there is some overlap in the types of neoplasms that can be detected with radiolabelled MIBG and in-pentetreotide, most studies imply that the indications may differ depending on the kind of tumour and clinical situation. MIBG scintigraphy, in our perspective, is currently the first-line treatment for functional phaeochromocytomas, paragangliomas, and neuroblastomas. Other neuroendocrine tumours, such as carcinoids, medullary thyroid carcinomas, and nonfunctioning paragangliomas, benefit from it\cite{board2002pancreatic}.

\section{DTPA-D-Phe-octreotide (pentetreotide)}
Somatostatin (SST) is a tiny multifunctional ciclic peptide produced by neuroendocrine and other cells found in a variety of organs and regions. Many neuroendocrin-derived cells and tumours have been found to have SST receptors (sstr). Molecular research revealed that there are five different types of somatostatin receptors, each with a different tissue distribution. Sstrl, sstr2 (with two splice variants, sstr2A and sstr2B), sstr3, sstr4, and sstr5 have been cloned and given cronological names. SST is not an appropriate tracer for imaging since it has a short half-life (1-3 minutes) and produces rebound hypersecretion upon withdrawal\cite{oberg2000state}. Octreotide-acetate was the first synthetic analogue created; the key limitations were the radiopharmaceutical's laborious labelling, limited availability, expensive cost, and high intestinal radioactivity. As a result, a novel tracer called DTPA-octreotide was created by combining ethilenetriamine-penta-acetic acid (DTPA) with octreotide (Pentetreotide). This tracer was first labelled with I23I and then with '"in.'"in-labeled pentetreotide binds to sstr2 exclusively. Because of its ability to bind to sstr2, which is found in many cellular membranes of neuroendocrine tumours, clinical trials have clearly proven that this receptor radiopharmaceutical is efficient in diagnosing and staging tumours and their metastases\cite{bajetta2000new}. Despite research efforts to generate more precise radioligands, "'in-pentetreotide" remains the radiopharmaceutical of choice for imaging neuroendocrine tumours at this time.\\ \\
In adults, 110-220 MBq of "'in-pentetreotide is injected; roughly 80\% of i.v. given radiolabelled "'in-pentetreotide is removed through the urine system. Even though somatostatin receptors are found in a wide range of tumours, "The principal indication for in-pentetreotide is as a diagnostic agent for the location of primary sites and metastases in GEP-tumours (carcinoids, islet cell tumours, gastrinomas, insulinomas, glucagonomas, VIPomas). Many other tumours have been seen using this technique "Somatostatin receptors are found in a high number of cancers, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), phaeochromocytoma, pituitary tumours, and CNS tumours. Somatostatin receptors are also found in breast carcinoma and renal tumours. However, the effectiveness of niIn-labeled pentetreotide scanning in patients with these tumours has yet to be proven.

\section{Clinical applications of nuclear medicine imaging}

\subsection{Gastroenteropancreatic tumours (GEP)}
Neuroendocrine GEP tumours are a group of neoplasms that arise from neuroendocrine cells found in the epitelium of the gastro-intestinal tract (carcinoids, islet cell tumours, gastrinomas, insulinomas, glucagonomas, VIPomas). The research and present experience at our Institute indicate that "in-pentetreotide scintigraphy is particularly effective for patients with small-bowel carcinoids that are difficult to localise using conventional methods." Because SPECT imaging can detect more lesions than planar imaging or radiological treatments, it is required in cases of clinical uncertainty. Carcinoids can be seen regardless of tumour location or hormonal hypersecretion, and whole-body scanning can reveal distant metastases. SST receptor imaging may be particularly beneficial for localising a tumour site when surgery is scheduled because of its great sensitivity.
Islet cell tumours emerge from endocrine pancreatic cells and are termed after the secreted hormone they produce (gastrinoma, VIPoma, Insuloma); 15\% of these tumours are not linked to hypersecretion syndrome. The most common type of islet cell tumour is gastrinoma, which accounts for 10\% of all GEP tumours. Somatostatin receptors are found in high quantities in most malignant islet cell carcinomas, according to clinical evidence. The sensitivity of "in-pentetreotide scintigraphy" has been reported to range from 70\% to 90\%, with some of the variance likely attributable to faulty scanning procedures and failure to do SPECT investigations.
